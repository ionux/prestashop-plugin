# PrestaShop BitPay Payment Plugin


## Brief Description

This plugin adds the ability for a merchant to accept bitcoin payments in their PrestaShop eCommerce store via BitPay.


## Detail Description

Bitcoin is a powerful new peer-to-peer payment platform for the next generation of financial technology. The decentralized nature of the Bitcoin network allows for a highly resilient value transfer infrastructure, and this allows merchants to gain greater profits.

This is because there are little to no fees for transferring Bitcoins from one person to another. Unlike other payment methods, Bitcoin payments cannot be reversed, so once you are paid you can ship!  No waiting days for a payment to clear.

## Troubleshooting

1. Ensure a valid SSL certificate is installed on your server. Also ensure your root CA cert is updated. If your CA cert is not current, you will see curl SSL verification errors.
2. Verify that your web server is not blocking POSTs from servers it may not recognize. Double check this on your firewall as well, if one is being used.
3. Check the version of this plugin against the official plugin repository to ensure you are using the latest version. Your issue might have been addressed in a newer version! See the [Releases](https://github.com/bitpay/prestashop-plugin/releases) page for the latest.
4. If all else fails, enable debug logging in the plugin options and send the log along with an email describing your issue **in detail** to support@bitpay.com.

**TIP**: When contacting support it will help us is you provide:

* The versions of Prestashop, PHP and this plugin
* Other plugins you have installed
  * Some plugins do not play nicely with others!
* Configuration settings for the plugin (most merchants take screenshots)
* Any log files that will help
  * Web server error logs are best!
* Screenshots of any error messages, if applicable
